----
This is C# Console Project Space Invaders-style Game of which title is Space.AI.NET().
This prompt is for GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, starting from an empty C# console project.
----

## Objective:
Build a modular, flicker-free, color-rendered console game titled "Space.AI.NET()".
The game must support input handling, player/enemy movement and bullets, UI, screenshot capture, double-buffered rendering, and a polished start screen layout.

## FILE: Program.cs
Responsibilities:
- Set UTF-8 output encoding for box-drawing characters:
    Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;
- Set Console.CursorVisible = false
- Call StartScreen.Show()
- After that, read the user input for speed selection:
    [1] Slow (default), [2] Medium, [3] Fast
    ENTER defaults to slow
- Clear the console and call GameManager.RunGameLoop()

## FILE: StartScreen.cs
Class: StartScreen
Responsibilities:
- Display the start screen with layout:
  - Title: "Space.AI.NET()" — centered horizontally
  - Subtitle (optional): "Built with .NET + AI for galactic defense"
  - Instructions and speed options: **left-aligned**
    Example layout:
    How to Play:
    ←   Move Left
    →   Move Right
    SPACE   Shoot
    S   Take Screenshot
    Q   Quit
    Select Game Speed:
    [1] Slow (default)
    [2] Medium
    [3] Fast
    Press ENTER for default

- Use Console.WindowWidth and Console.WindowHeight to align content
- This class is for display only — input is handled in Program.cs

## FILE: GameManager.cs
Class: GameManager
Responsibilities:
- Manage game state and the main loop
- Initialize player, enemies, bullets, UI
- Handle input using Console.KeyAvailable and Console.ReadKey(true)
    - Do not use background threads for input
- Update all entities
- Implement double-buffered rendering:
    - Maintain current and previous char/color buffers
    - Update only changed characters using Console.SetCursorPosition()
    - Do not use Console.Clear()
- Hide cursor with Console.CursorVisible = false
- Draw bounding box using Unicode box-drawing characters:
    - ┌ ┐ └ ┘ for corners
    - ─ for horizontal edges
    - │ for vertical edges
    - Do not use fallback ASCII characters like '+', '-', '|', or '?'
    - REQUIREMENT: Set Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8 before any rendering to ensure proper character support
- Draw UI inside the top of the box:
    Format: "Score: 0000   Time: 00s   Bullets: 2/3"
- Expose GetRenderState() for ScreenshotService
- Trigger ScreenshotService periodically and on 'S' key

## FILE: Player.cs
Class: Player
Responsibilities:
- Rendered as 'A'
- Controlled with Left/Right arrow keys
- Fires up to 3 bullets using Spacebar
- Constrained to lower area of screen

## FILE: Enemy.cs
Class: Enemy
Responsibilities:
- 8 total enemies:
    - Top row (5): ><, oo, ><, oo, >< — ConsoleColor.Red
    - Bottom row (3): /O\ — ConsoleColor.DarkYellow
- Move left to right, sweep-style
- After each full sweep, move down one row
- Only one enemy may shoot at a time

## FILE: Bullet.cs
Class: Bullet
Responsibilities:
- Bullets move vertically
- Player bullets: '^'
- Enemy bullets: 'v'
- Detect collisions with enemies or player

## FILE: ScreenshotService.cs
Class: ScreenshotService
Responsibilities:
- Create and clear a folder named "screenshoots" on game start
- Capture screenshots automatically and manually (S key)
- Use GameManager.GetRenderState() to retrieve buffers
- Render to PNG or JPG using System.Drawing.Bitmap and Graphics
- Use Unicode-compatible monospace font ("Consolas" or "Lucida Console") for correct visuals
- Include:
    - Bounding box using Unicode characters (┌ ┐ └ ┘ ─ │)
    - UI line
    - Player, enemies, bullets

## FILE: RenderState.cs (optional)
Class: RenderState
Responsibilities:
- Maintain current frame buffers for characters and colors

## Visual Settings:
- Player ('A'): ConsoleColor.Cyan
- 2-char enemies (><, oo): ConsoleColor.Red
- 3-char enemies (/O\): ConsoleColor.DarkYellow
- Player bullets: '^', ConsoleColor.White
- Enemy bullets: 'v', ConsoleColor.White
- UI text: ConsoleColor.White

## Rendering Rules:
- Do not use Console.Clear()
- Use double-buffered rendering (only update differences)
- Hide cursor using Console.CursorVisible = false
- Use correct Unicode box-drawing characters:
    ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ─ │
- REQUIREMENT: Set Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8 before any output
- Never use fallback characters like '+', '-', '|', or '?'
